## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The second solo project that I undertook. The second project has become much easier to accomplish thanks to my experience from completing the first challenge, but I still 
understood that there were many ways I could refine my first challenge. During this challenge, I focused not only on completing the challenge but making the code
more readable, clearer, and maintanable. Furthermore, I deepened my understanding of responsive design and its implementation.
